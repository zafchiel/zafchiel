Flashcards is a web application that allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** flashcards and decks of flashcards.

<br />

Users can **share** their decks with others and **search** for public decks. With a single click, users can add a public deck to their collection.

<br />

**Technologies I used:**

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - solid fullstack framework with excelent developer experience
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [drizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - battle-tested database with typesafe SQL-like ORM
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/) - fast and efficient way to go about styling
- [LuciaAuth](https://lucia-auth.com/) - utilities making authorization a breze

<br />

Flashcards are fully operatable with keyboard and I use it myself for learning.

<style>
  a {
    color: var(--color-primary);
    font-weight: 600;
  }
</style>
