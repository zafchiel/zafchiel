Drawing board is a react app for **drawing and wireframing**. It's built **from scratch**, without using any libraries to manipulate canvas.

It's a simple drawing board, still **in development**, with a few tools like pen, eraser, and color picker. You can also save your drawing as an image.

**Technologies I used:**

- [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - efficient way to go about styling
