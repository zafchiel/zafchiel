Link shortener is a simple application for **shortening links** and **creating QR** codes. Shortened links are **automatically copied** to the clipboard for your convenience.

You can **download** your QR code as a **PNG file** in three sizes: 200x200, 400x400, and 600x600.

**Technologies I used:**

- [React](https://react.dev/) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - fast meta framework on top of React
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) - blazingly fast in-memory database
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - efficient way to go about styling
